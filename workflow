# üé¨ Amazon Influencer Workflow

This is my typical workflow for creating Amazon Influencer content, from product selection to publishing and performance monitoring.

---

## Step 1: Product Selection
- üîç Identify trending, seasonal, or personally used products
- ü§ù Accept inbound sponsorship offers (or pitch brands directly)
- üìù Ensure product is eligible for Amazon Influencer content placement

---

## Step 2: Filming the Content
- Unbox and demo the product
- Keep it natural and to the point (45‚Äì90 seconds)
- Highlight key benefits and personal use-case
- Shoot in natural light, minimal background clutter

---

## Step 3: Editing
- No self branding due to terms
- Trim dead time and add close-ups of product features
- Export in Amazon-friendly format (vertical or horizontal depending on platform)
- I do my best to do a 1 take with minimal editing if possible.

---

## Step 4: Optimization
- Write a clean, SEO-friendly title and description
- Tag the product properly
- Choose an engaging thumbnail using Photoshop and AI or auto-thumbnail if time-constrained

---

## Step 5: Upload & Track
- Upload to Amazon Influencer storefront
- Cross-post to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels (when applicable)
- Track views

---

## Step 6: Maintenance
- Periodically revisit high-performing videos to refresh thumbnails or titles
- Remove underperforming or expired product content
- Repurpose good clips for other content formats (compilations, Top 5s, etc.)
