# 💡 Lessons Learned from the Amazon Influencer Program

Over time, I’ve discovered what works (and what doesn’t) in the world of affiliate content creation. Here are some of the most valuable takeaways:

---

## ✅ What Works

- **Be authentic** – People connect more with honesty than polished pitch
- **Short and focused** – Viewers want quick, visual info, not fluff
- **Thumbnails matter (sometimes)** – Bright lighting and close-ups drive clicks
- **Niche down** – Sticking to a product category builds authority, but also not totally necessary on AMZ Influencers
- **Cross-posting** – Reposting Amazon content to TikTok/YouTube boosts reach. You already created the content might as well use it.

---

## ⚠️ What to Avoid

- **Overediting** – Too much polish = less trust
- **Generic scripts** – Speak from real experience, not templates
- **Ignoring analytics** – Watch what performs and double down

## 💸 Passive Income Isn't “Passive”

- While the income is recurring, creating it takes consistent effort
- Sponsored content requires relationship-building and follow-through
- The more systems and templates you create, the easier it becomes

## 🔁 Always Be Iterating

- Try new formats (Top 5s, vs. battles, seasonal roundups)
- Test different title/thumbnail combos
- Reach out to new brands every quarter
