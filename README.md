# 📦 Amazon Influencer Program – Case Study

As part of the Amazon Influencer Program, I’ve built a content system that generates passive income through unboxing videos and product reviews. This repo documents my journey, strategy, and ongoing performance with both sponsored and self-initiated content.

---

## 🎥 What I Do

- Create unboxing videos and honest product reviews across platforms on Amazon (content can be uploaded elsewhere as well)
- Blend **sponsored content** (from brands who reach out) with **organic reviews** of products I naturally use
- Focus on **authenticity and trust** to increase conversions and CTR
- Monetize via affiliate links and storefront visibility

---

## 📈 Outcomes

- Passive monthly income from affiliate commissions
- Sponsored product partnerships with brands, usually related to something I already reviewed.
- Optimized video thumbnails, product titles, and tags for better discovery
- Built a repeatable content pipeline

---

## 🔧 Workflow

1. Product research or brand outreach
2. Record and edit unboxing/review video
3. Optimize title, description, and keywords
4. Upload to Amazon Influencer page (and cross-post if relevant)
5. Monitor performance and tweak thumbnails or tags based on CTR

*(See `workflow.md` for full breakdown)*

## 🧩 Tools Used

- Amazon Influencer backend
- Amazon Influencer built in analytics
- Video editors Capcut and Davinci Resolve
- Manual A/B testing on titles and descriptions
- Camera = DJI Osmo Pocket 3

---

## 🔎 Sponsored vs Organic Content

- **Sponsored**: Brands send products + pay a review fee. I maintain editorial independence.
- **Organic**: I review things I’ve bought and use personally — no payment, but affiliate commission if it performs.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Trust matters more than hype. “Real” performs better.
- Amazon’s algorithm favors short, direct titles
- Good lighting + thumbnail = more than a fancy edit
- Don’t overthink — consistency wins
